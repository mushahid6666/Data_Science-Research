In the present global atmosphere, practices that for three centuries have been considered uncivilized, such as capturing civilians or even entire communities for ransom, have begun to reappear. <BR> Pursuing bold and provocative paths of inquiry, van Creveld posits the inadequacies of our most basic ideas as to who fights wars and why and broaches the inevitability of mans need to play at war.

This deivce from NextGen will RFize your IR remote, giving it a range of up to 100 feet, room-to-room control, and the other bonuses of having an RF remote.How It WorksNextGen includes two rechargeable 2/3-AAA batteries, which slide into their RF transmitter to fit the standard AAA battery compartment on your exisitng remote. An adapter is also included for AA compartments.Replace one of your remotes batteries with this device, and it picks up the hint of radio-frequency signals emitted by IR remotes, amplifies it, and sends it to the base station. The base station then emits the IR signal, effectively turning your IR remote into an RF model.The base station has a built-in charger for powering up the custom batteries.The ResultsThis device lets you go from room-to-room and control your components from up to 100 + feet away, with no direct line-of-sight needed. It even works through closet doors and closed entertainment system cabinets.Unlike other remote control extenders, theres no need to attach anything to the front of your remote, or to be limited to using it in one room.

Pure Bare Copper is a superior conductor to the copper clad aluminum (CCA) conductors used in most other inexpensive speaker wire. CCA is only about 68% as conductive as pure bare copper. This additional resistance is added to the impedance of your speakers and can negatively effect the sound.<br><br>For the wire to have no audible effect the total wire resistance should be no more than 5% of the lowest impedance of your speakers. Even speakers rated for a nominal 8-ohms may dip to as low as 4-ohms at some frequencies which further reduces the total cable resistance allowed in the wire. Using Pure Bare Copper speaker wire ensures that the total load put on the amplifier remains as close as possible to the impedance curve of your speakers.<br><br>For example a 16AWG 2-conductor Pure Bare Copper speaker wire has a total resistance of 0.803 ohms per 100 feet (both directions must be considered). By comparison a 16AWG 2-conductor CCA speaker wire has a total resistance of 1.181 ohms per 100 feet. Assuming 4 ohms is the lowest impedance of your speakers a speaker wire run can be no more 0.2-ohms total. 20 feet of 16AWG Pure Bare Copper would be 0.1606 ohms well under the 0.2-ohm limit. On the other hand 20 feet of 16AWG CCA would be 0.2362 ohms well OVER the 0.2-ohm limit.<br><br>Each conductor is jacketed with color-coded PVC for easy polarity identification. The entire cable assembly is jacketed in a white CL2-rated PVC material. The CL2 rating indicates that the cable complies with fire safety and insurance requirements making it safe for use inside the walls of residential class buildings.<br><br><br>*** 30-day easy returns.

Pure Bare Copper is a superior conductor to the copper clad aluminum (CCA) conductors used in most other inexpensive speaker wire. CCA is only about 68% as conductive as pure bare copper. This additional resistance is added to the impedance of your speakers and can negatively effect the sound.<br><br>For the wire to have no audible effect the total wire resistance should be no more than 5% of the lowest impedance of your speakers. Even speakers rated for a nominal 8-ohms may dip to as low as 4-ohms at some frequencies which further reduces the total cable resistance allowed in the wire. Using Pure Bare Copper speaker wire ensures that the total load put on the amplifier remains as close as possible to the impedance curve of your speakers.<br><br>For example a 16AWG 2-conductor Pure Bare Copper speaker wire has a total resistance of 0.803 ohms per 100 feet (both directions must be considered). By comparison a 16AWG 2-conductor CCA speaker wire has a total resistance of 1.181 ohms per 100 feet. Assuming 4 ohms is the lowest impedance of your speakers a speaker wire run can be no more 0.2-ohms total. 20 feet of 16AWG Pure Bare Copper would be 0.1606 ohms well under the 0.2-ohm limit. On the other hand 20 feet of 16AWG CCA would be 0.2362 ohms well OVER the 0.2-ohm limit.<br><br>One side of the clear outer PVC jacket is marked with an easily visible blue stripe to indicate polarity.<br><br><br>*** 30-day easy returns.
